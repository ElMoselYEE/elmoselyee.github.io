# elmoselyee.github.io

This is the source code for [blaynemoseley.com](blaynemoseley.com).

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation, 
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for build and 
deploy, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for serving 
the content.

# Usage

To run locally, you first need to [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

The following command will generate the assets and start
up a simple server at http://localhost:4000

    bundle exec jekyll serve

# Deploy

No action needed.

GitHub Pages has special integration with GitHub actions
already, so the build and deployment will both be kicked
off automatically when code is committed and merged into 
mainline.
