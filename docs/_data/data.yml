    title: My Story
    summary: |
      Hi, I'm Blayne, and I've been tinkering with technology nearly my
      entire life. I entered the programming world by accident when I was
      14 as I sought to make my Amazon Associates referral site more dynamic.
      After I spent a few nights reading through the PHP manual, I looked
      back and realized...this is programming. I've been hooked ever since.
      
      As I explored this discipline more deeply--from freelancing to designing
      to building ecommerce websites--through high school and college--I realized my 
      true passion of building APIs and designing systems.

education:
    - university: University of Texas at Dallas
      time: 2006 - 2010

experiences:
    - role: Staff Software Engineer
      time: 2022 - Present
      company: Twilio Segment, San Francisco
      details: |
        I am on the storage team which is responsible for part of the processing
        component of the ingestion pipeline that processes up to 1 billion events
        per second.
        
        <i>Go, DynamoDB, Kafka</i>

    - role: Enterprise Architect
      time: 2020 - 2022
      company: Solera, Westlake, TX (Aquired DealerSocket)
      details: |
        My role as enterprise architect involved understanding the issues
        faced by engineering teams across the enterprise and to guide these
        teams to work efficiently. I accomplished this by sharing lessons learned 
        as well as establishing standards for common processes such as the 
        definition of a production-ready microservice. 
        
        Further, I designed architectures and formed execution plans for numerous 
        key company initiatives including search infrastructure and SSO. I
        identified opportunities for reusable services within the company to
        save engineers (and the company) hundreds of hours of duplicate work.
        
        Accomplishments:
        
        - Created production-readiness microservice standards
        - Created service initiative process
        - Hardened and evangelized multiple microservices for reuse within the company
    - role: Application Architect
      time: 2018 - 2022
      company: DealerSocket, Irving, TX
      details: |
        As the application architect for the Inventory+ platform, it was my duty
        to both decompose new system requirements as well as define the technical
        runway needed to support those requirements. I scoped these epics out and
        worked closely with the engineering teams to refine the requirements. On 
        multiple occasions I built POCs to alleviate any uncertainty the teams 
        might have.
        
        I carried the platform on a journey to over a dozen microservices. I oversaw
        these services from ideation to release. To ensure highly reliable and scalable
        services, I employed the use of cloud-native architectures including serverless
        and auto-scaling infrastructures.
        
        Another key arc throughout this role was a focus on DevOps, both from a technical
        capability as well as a people and process standpoint. Through my leadership our 
        three-team product was able to sustain a deployment rate of over a dozen successful
        deployments per month.
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Established and refined architecture patterns and practices for new microservices
        - Overhauled photo serving infrastructure, shaving 15% off the overall 
        platform infrastructure cost
        - Aligned seven teams by holding regular tech sessions to share and distill 
        knowledge
        
        <i>AWS Lambda, Python, Flask, AWS ECS, Docker, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
        Kafka, ElasticSearch, AWS Glue, Spark, AWS Redshift</i>
    - role: Principal Software Engineer
      time: 2015 - 2018
      company: DealerSocket, Irving, TX
      details: |
        During my time as principal software engineer, I was able to consistenly 
        deliver projects on time with high quality results. Mentoring
        other engineers, on and off my teams, is something I enjoyed a lot as 
        I really valued the mentoring I received earlier on in my career. I
        presented a number of tech talks that helped teams learn their way
        around the overly-complex application we all inherited.
        
        I was selected to be on a number tiger teams to help accelerate
        various projects including the inception of our microservice's tech
        stack, our monitoring stack, and data analysis for our top clients.
        
        I designed and implemented our next-gen analytics platform, including 
        data streams and data warehouse, to ensure we could deliver reliable 
        and accurate insights to our customers quicker than we ever could before.
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Made key technical decisions that shaped the company's microservice
        framework
        - Implemented monitoring stack including metrics, alarms, and integration
        - Researched, built, and maintained highly-scalable analytics platform
        
        <i>AWS Redshift, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Grafana, InfluxDB / Kapacitor,
        AWS ECS / Docker, Java, Spring Boot, Perl, MongoDB</i>
    - role: Senior Software Engineer
      time: 2012 - 2015
      company: DealerSocket, Irving, TX
      details: |
        I worked on the eCarList application as it was being acquired by a bigger
        company (DealerTrack) and was experiencing many growing pains. This meant
        the system was ripe for improvement, so I would take on a number of personal
        projects to improve the state of the codebase and stability of the system.
        One of the most notable projects I worked was the rework of the testing
        platform, which I stabilized (allowing it to run on personal machines) and
        optimized (from 10 mins down to 10s to execute).
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Overhauled product-wide testing platform
        - Applied profiling techniques to identify inefficient code, resulting
        in roughly 2x speed improvement across core pieces of application
        
        <i>Perl, Linux, SSH, MySQL, MongoDB</i>
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: 2010 - 2012
      company: AmeriFlex, Frisco, TX
      details: |
        Worked with a team to build third-party benefits administration
        application which controlled nearly $20m of FSA and HSA
        balances. 
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Overhauled core data ingestion service to be 4x faster by
        using multi-threading
        
        <i>PHP, MySQL</i>
