    summary: |
      Hi, I'm Blayne. I am a self-motivated tech enthusaist who loves 
      continuous learning and improving. I've been hacking away since I 
      was 14, when I learned programming by accident when I read the PHP 
      manual because I wanted to make my Amazon Associates website more 
      dynamic.
