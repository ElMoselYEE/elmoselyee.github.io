    title: Who I Am
    summary: |
      Hi, I'm Blayne. I am a self-motivated tech enthusaist who loves 
      continuous learning and improving. I've been hacking away since I 
      was 14, when I learned programming by accident when I read the PHP 
      manual because I wanted to make my Amazon Associates website more 
      dynamic. Since then I've enjoyed challenging myself to build whatever
      things come to my mind.

education:
    - university: University of Texas at Dallas
      time: 2006 - 2010

experiences:
    - role: Enterprise Architect
      time: 2020 - Present
      company: Solera, Westlake, TX (Aquired DealerSocket)
      details: |
        My role as enterprise architect involved understanding the issues
        faced by engineering teams across the enterprise and to guide these
        teams to work efficiently by sharing lessons learned as well as
        establishing standards for common processes such as the definition 
        of a production-ready microservice. 
        
        Further, I designed architectures and formed execution plans for numerous 
        key company initiatives including search infrastructure and SSO. I
        identified opportunities for reusable services within the company to
        save engineers (and the company) hundreds of hours of duplicate work.
        
        Accomplishments:
        
        - Created production-readiness microservice standards
        - Created service initiative process
        - Hardened and evangelized two microservices for reuse within the company
    - role: Application Architect
      time: 2018 - Current
      company: DealerSocket, Irving, TX
      details: |
        As the application architect for the Inventory+ platform, it was my duty
        to both decompose new system requirements as well as define the technical
        runway needed to support those requirements. I scoped these epics out and
        worked closely with the engineering teams to refine the requirements. Often,
        I built proof-of-concepts to alleviate any uncertainty the teams might have.
        
        I carried the platform on a journey to over a dozen microservices. I built
        these services with cutting-edge AWS cloud technology including managed and
        serverless offerings resulting in extremely reliable, scalable, maintainable,
        and efficient services.
        
        Another key arc throughout me having the position was a focus on DevOps, both
        from a technical capability as well as a people and process standpoint. Through
        my leadership our three-team product was able to sustain a deployment rate
        of over a dozen deployments per month.
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Established and refined architecture patterns and practices for new microservices
        - Overhauled photo serving infrastructure, shaving a massive 15% off the overall 
        platform infrastructure cost
        - Aligned seven teams by holding regular tech sessions to share and distill 
        knowledge
        
        <i>AWS Lambda, Python, Flask, AWS ECS, Docker, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
        Kafka, ElasticSearch, AWS Glue, Spark, AWS Redshift</i>
    - role: Principal Software Engineer
      time: 2015 - 2018
      company: DealerSocket, Irving, TX
      details: |
        As principal software engineer, I led numerous teams to achieve top-tier
        delivery rates by following the practices of scrum and agile. Mentoring
        other engineers, on and off my teams, is something I enjoyed a lot as 
        I really valued the mentoring I received earlier on in my career. I
        presented a number of tech talks that helped teams learn their way
        around the overly-complex application we all inherited.
        
        A number of times I was chosen to be on a tiger team to help accelerate
        various projects including the inception of our microservice's tech
        stack, our monitoring stack, and data analysis for our top clients.
        
        Just before I was promoted to architect I designed and implemented
        our next-gen analytics platform, including data streams and data
        warehouse, to ensure we could deliver reliable and accurate insights
        to our customers quicker than we ever could before.
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Helped define microservice framework
        - Implemented monitoring stack including metrics, alarms, and integration
        - Researched, built, and maintained highly-scalable analytics platform
        
        <i>AWS Redshift, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Grafana, InfluxDB / Kapacitor,
        AWS ECS / Docker, Java, Spring Boot, Perl, MongoDB</i>
    - role: Senior Software Engineer
      time: 2012 - 2015
      company: DealerSocket, Irving, TX
      details: |
        This was my first experience working on an enterprise application, so I
        soaked in all the knowledge I could from my peers. Many tools I began
        using for the first time including Linux, SSH, Agile, Perl, MongoDB, and
        more. 
        
        One of the things I loved most about the role was the immense room I
        found for improvement in the product. I would refactor huge sections of
        core code. But, I also broke things while doing this, which is where 
        I learned probably the most important skill of my entire career: testing.
        As I became obsessed with this new skill of mine, I reworked our unit
        testing platform to separate unit and integration tests, allowing developers
        to have an actual test suite they could run on their machines.
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Overhauled product-wide testing platform
        - Applied profiling techniques to identify inefficient code, resulting
        in roughly 2x speed improvement across core pieces of application
        
        <i>Perl, Linux, SSH, MySQL, MongoDB</i>
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: 2010 - 2012
      company: AmeriFlex, Frisco, TX
      details: |
        Worked with a team to build third-party benefits administration
        application which controlled nearly $20m of FSA and HSA
        balances. 
        
        Accomplishments:
        - Overhauled core data ingestion service to be 4x faster by
        using multi-threading
        
        <i>PHP, MySQL</i>
